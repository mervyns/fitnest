# FitNest - Your Online Community For Fitness Enthusiasts [FitNest Link](https://fitnest.tech)
FitNest started out as a fitness/nutrition tracker that I did for Project 2 of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Course. You can view the GitHub Repo [here](https://github.com/mervyns/project-2-fitnest). It was built using React-Views, Express and a PostgreSQL Database. 

However, upon the completion of my GA-WDI Course, I decided to redo FitNest to become a more robust web application as the application of tech to fitness and offline-to-online is something which I was interested in. I also found that I was attending alot of group fitness activities, but they were being tracked via WhatsApp groups. With that in mind, I decided to build a sort of Meet-Up app, where fitness enthusiasts could organize and post their various activities.

## Tech Stack:
### Server
- Firebase. I decided to use Firebase for the sake of simplicity and also to familiarize myself with this technology.

### Front-End
- React 
- Redux for State Management

### APIs
- Google Maps and Places API

## Getting Started
1. Clone the database

Installation
1.	Ensure that you have yarn/npm installed on your local machine, otherwise install yarn/npm.
2.	Run `yarn init`
3.  `yarn` â€“ to install all dependencies found in package.json file
4.  `yarn start` to run the development server

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create fitness events for all to view and join.
- As a user, I want to be able to organize my activities and see who is attending.
- As a user, I want to be able to view other users' profiles and also create my profile.
